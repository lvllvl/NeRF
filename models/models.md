This is where NERF network is defined. A 3D coordinate mapping and viewing direction to a color and density. THis should invovle: 
 - MLP for the main NERF function
 - Implementing positional encoding to map the 3D coordinate into a higher-dimensional space for better representation
 `nerf.py` file should include MLP, with functions for forward pass and network init
