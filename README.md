# NeRF
Implementation of NeRF

A high level overview  of the project. 

### 1. **Project Structure Overview**
To keep the project organized, here's a potential folder structure:
```
NeRF_Project/
│
├── data/                      # Directory for storing training data (images, camera poses, etc.)
├── models/                    # Store model definitions
├── render/                    # Code related to rendering the final images
├── train/                     # Code for training the NeRF model
├── utils/                     # Utility functions (positional encoding, ray generation, etc.)
├── checkpoints/               # Store model checkpoints during training
├── main.py                    # Entry point to run training and rendering
└── config.py                  # Configuration settings for hyperparameters, paths, etc.
```

### 2. **Key Components**
Break the project into the following core areas:

#### A. **Data Loading (`data/`)**
NeRF requires input images of the scene from multiple viewpoints and the corresponding camera poses. You'll need a way to:
   - Load images from disk.
   - Parse camera parameters (intrinsic/extrinsic).
   
   You'll likely create a `data_loader.py` file that handles this, where you can define a class to load and process the images and poses.

#### B. **Model Definition (`models/`)**
This is where you define the NeRF network. The key idea is to map a 3D coordinate and viewing direction to a color and density. This will involve:
   - A **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** for the main NeRF function.
   - Implementing **positional encoding** to map the 3D coordinates into a higher-dimensional space for better representation.
   
   You can start by defining a `nerf.py` file where the main MLP is defined, with functions for forward passes and network initialization.

#### C. **Rendering (`render/`)**
This involves ray tracing and volume rendering. The rendering loop will:
   - Generate rays from the camera into the scene.
   - Integrate the NeRF output (color and density) along each ray to determine the final color of each pixel.
   
   You can start by implementing a `ray_tracing.py` file that handles ray generation and sampling, as well as a `volume_rendering.py` file that computes the final pixel colors.

#### D. **Training (`train/`)**
You'll need a script to train the NeRF model, including:
   - Sampling rays randomly from the images.
   - Running those rays through the NeRF model.
   - Calculating a loss function (e.g., MSE between predicted and true pixel values).
   - Updating the model weights using backpropagation.
   
   You might have a `train.py` file to handle the training loop, where you will:
   - Initialize the model.
   - Load the data.
   - Run optimization.

#### E. **Utilities (`utils/`)**
This folder will house smaller utility functions that don’t belong directly in the other components, such as:
   - **Positional encoding**: Mapping 3D coordinates to higher-dimensional space.
   - **Ray generation**: Generating rays from camera poses.
   - **Loss functions**: Any custom loss functions you need beyond standard MSE.
   
   You can start with a `positional_encoding.py` and a `loss_functions.py` to handle these utilities.

#### F. **Main Script (`main.py`)**
This file will be the entry point of your project. It will:
   - Load the configurations (hyperparameters, paths, etc.) from `config.py`.
   - Initialize the model, data loaders, and training scripts.
   - Run training or rendering based on user input.
   
   Start with a simple command-line interface that lets you choose between training or rendering:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       if args.mode == "train":
           train_nerf()
       elif args.mode == "render":
           render_scene()
   ```

### 3. **What to Start With**
Here’s a rough guide on how you can begin:
   1. **Data Loading**: Write code that loads images and camera poses. This is critical because you'll need these inputs for both training and rendering.
   2. **NeRF Model**: Define the architecture for the MLP that will take in 3D points and output color and density.
   3. **Positional Encoding**: Implement this early since the NeRF paper relies on this to map low-dimensional inputs to higher-dimensional space.
   4. **Rendering**: Once you have a trained model, move on to ray marching and rendering the scene.
